Multiplayer Pong In HTML5
=========================

Designed for a 4th year Internet Computing course, this project is still a WIP.  The goal of the project is to create a
multiplayer pong game that can be played over the internet.  To make it playable over the internet each client must
implement movement prediction to reduce input lag.  We are currently working on implementing movement prediction with
the ball.
